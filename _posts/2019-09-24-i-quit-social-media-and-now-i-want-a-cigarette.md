Social media is like smoking. It takes a while to get addicted. You do it because everyone is doing it.
It gives you a dopamine kick and pretty soon you develop a habit. Once you quit, you're relieved,
but you also miss it when you're sitting on a toilet.

Nine months ago I deleted my Facebook and Twitter accounts. The online suicide had to do with the
bad ratio between time spent scrolling and finding something worth the attention.
For every “good” post I had to consume thirty “bad” ones. 30/1 is just not that good of a ratio.

I also have a problem with populated to-do lists. If there's a box of cookies next to the computer,
I'll continue working once the box is empty. Same thing with unread notifications.
I absolutely cannot understand people who have 153 unread notifications. They're probably
the same people who sleep with a blanket turned the other way around &mdash; zipper facing the head.

On top of that, there's an

promising it will improve their lives, and thus I proceeded with the e-harakiri.

Years of giving in to instant gratification showed its face right away.
I continued to routinely grab the phone whenever I passed it by, but since there
were no notifications to clear, I checked my email so much more often.

The urge eventually faded away without any significant improvement on the mental wellbeing front.
It's not that I was in a bad place mentally, but any bump in that department doesn't hurt.
[Teenagers might be more susceptible though](https://youtu.be/FG6HbWw2RF4?t=4702).

I upgraded my quest to tranquility by removing work email accounts and Slack from the phone
and revoking it bedroom access. Still, not much of a difference. Maybe it just takes more time, I don't know.

Articles urging you to quit social media list several benefits.

_You'll stop feeling inferior to others._ That's true. I used to mind my own business when riding a train.
Now I judge people for being glued to their phones.

_Having an abundance of free time on your hands._ Not an abundance, but bits and pieces of extra
free time do compound over a longer period. I did manage to spend more time
[reading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525561358) and building
[side projects](https://hackernews-exploded.hadalin.me).

_Being happy, motivated and in a good shape._ I'll admit, it does feel great to not use any
product associated with [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2LIXcbDiZA).
Whenever there's news about some data leakage, I smile a little knowing it doesn't concern me.
[Or does it](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=facebook+shadow+profile)? It also feels great sneaking
out of the Twitter “where everything's refutable and arguments don't matter” party.

_You spend more time with your real friends._ No, I miss some of my virtual friends and their witty posts.
I also miss staying in touch.

I don't regret quitting and I don't regret ever being on it. I would pay a monthly
subscription for an ad-free version of Facebook. The kind that doesn't
[track what porn you're watching](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/opinion/google-facebook-sex-websites.html)

I kept my LinkedIn account. I keep lying to myself I need it for work. Maybe it's just
hard to say the [last goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MMXjunSx80).

Update: So… yeah, I’m back on Facebook. Turns out the drumming community I joined is using a Facebook group to stay connected and share updates.
