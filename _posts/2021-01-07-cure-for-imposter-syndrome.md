Most likely, it’s only you who thinks you're not good enough. Your “operating system” has a bug that raises too many instances of <code>NotGoodEnoughException</code>.

Even if someone else thinks you're not good enough, it's probably because they have this bug too. People climb many hierarchies&mdash;power, money, popularity, etc., and in doing so, they advertently, but more often than not, inadvertently put other people down to lift themselves. Have this in mind when someone is rude to you.

How to fix this bug? The solution is not that hard, but it requires time + effort. What you have to do is first install the <code><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=eckhart+tolle">mindfulness</a></code>&ast; module. This module interrupts the cognitive module each time NotGoodEnoughException is raised and puts the handling of this exception at the top of the priority queue. In a sense, good mindfulness could be compared to having decent server logs&mdash;situational awareness for the self.

If you think the above paragraph is written poorly, your “OS” probably raised NotGoodEnoughException just now ;)

You handle the exception as follows. Get familiar with the <code>/self/v2/mind</code> API endpoint and make a POST request with the following body each time NotGoodEnoughException is raised:

<pre>
{
  "youAreEnough": true
}
</pre>

It might take weeks, months, or even years before the number of exceptions starts to drop, but it <em>does</em> drop. The reason this works is that it’s the real you, the one who experiences pain, joy, and life, the one above thoughts, emotions, and sensations, who decides to “program” your “kernel”. The key is within you.

To supercharge, consider running <code>install patience --save-dev</code> and opening an issue at the <code>friend/talk</code> repository.

Take care!

<p class="footnotes">
&ast; Eckhart Tolle, who I referenced, teaches about awareness and presence. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIsl6_SuEYY">does not use the term <em>mindfulness</em></a>, but I used it anyway because it's popular.
